
This ensures:
- Anchor is closer to the Positive sample
- Anchor is farther from the Negative sample by at least a margin

This loss is ideal for similarity-based learning problems.

### 5️⃣ Training Loop
- Forward pass through the Siamese Network
- Compute triplet loss
- Backpropagation using the **Adam optimizer**
- Batch-wise training using `DataLoader`
- Training progress tracked using `tqdm`

---

### 6️⃣ Embedding Extraction
After training:
- All images are passed through the trained model
- Embeddings are extracted and stored
- These embeddings represent images in a learned feature space

---

### 7️⃣ Image Retrieval & Evaluation
Given a query image:
- Its embedding is computed
- Distances to all stored embeddings are calculated
- Closest images are retrieved based on distance
- Results are visualized using `plot_closest_imgs`
